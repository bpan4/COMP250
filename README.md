# COMP250 Winter2020 Introduction to Computer Science

## 1. Overview
This course introduces you to two core topics in computer science: data structures and algorithms. You will learn basic data structures for lists (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues), trees (search trees, heaps), and graphs. You will also learn basic algorithms both recursive and non-recursive that use these data structures. You will also learn how to analyze such algorithms in terms of the amount of computation they use. These data structures, algorithms, and analysis tools all will be used heavily in subsequent CS courses.

The assignments in the course will use Java programming language. You will learn how to implement basic data structures and algorithms using Java. Java is a object oriented language, and so you will also learn some of the basic ideas of object oriented design such as how classes can be organized into hierarchies and how variables and methods defined in the classes of the hierarchy are related to each other.

## 2. Prerequisites
According to https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/comp-250 the official prerequisite is "Familiarity with a high level programming language and CEGEP level Math."

Here are more details about the programming and math prerequisites.

###### 2.1 Programming Prerequisites
Starting in Fall 2019, both COMP 202 and COMP 208 switched from Java to Python. For this reason, we will be assuming that students coming into 250 know basic Python at the level of COMP 202. All programming assignments in COMP 250 will be in Java, and most of the examples seen in class will also use Java. We will be using the  rst two weeks of the semester learning enough Java to allow you all to enjoy and successfully complete COMP 250.

Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the programming prerequisite:
  Q: I took COMP 208 (before Fall 2019) and so I know some C but not Java (nor Python). What am I missing?
  
  A: If you know some C, then you are in a strong position to learn Java because you are very familiar with types already. However, you don't yet know about objects and classes. We will learn about them, and how to use them in Java, during the first couple of weeks.

  Q: I took a programming course prior to coming to McGill in which we used one of Python / Matlab / Javascript / R. What am I missing?
  A: As described above, we will be spending some time together learning Java. The assumption we will be making is that you have a certain level of experience in Python. Be sure that you are comfortable with the basics elements of programming from COMP 202, in particular, variables, expressions, and assignments, conditional statements (if-then-else), loops (while, for), methods/functions, data structures such as list/arrays and strings, input/output from a keyboard and to a console and from/to a file. If you are not comfortable with these basics, then you should take COMP 202 or 204 or 208 this semester, instead of COMP 250.

  Q: I have not taken a programming course.  Instead I learned programming on my own, e.g. online course. How much programming experience do I need?
  A: You should have at least 50 hours experience programming in whatever language you do know. That is roughly the minimum amount of experience that a student who has taken COMP 202/208/etc already has. If you don't have that level of experience, then you should not take COMP 250 this semester, and instead you should take an introduction to programming course, namely COMP 202 or 204 or 208.
  
###### 2.2 Math Prerequisites
The offcial prerequisite is "CEGEP level math". This means specifically Calculus 1 and 2. Although COMP 250 will not use derivatives and integrals, some of the ideas from Calculus will be used. For example, we will use the limits of a sequence when we discuss the runtime of different algorithms and we compare one algorithm to another. We also will use sequences and series, and so you are expected to know the difference between an arithmetic versus geometric series. Another important  concept from Calculus is logarithms. You need to know how logarithms are defined - namely a logarithm is the inverse of an exponential. You also need to know and understand the basic rules of logarithms. 
Finally, the course will require that you are able to think logically. Although most of you will not (yet) have studied formal logic, you will nonetheless be expected
to understand at least intuitively what statements like \for all" and \for each" mean, and to understand intuitively how to negate such statements. Such mathematical thinking will come more naturally to those of you who are stronger in mathematics, but everyone is capable of such thinking to some extent and it improves with practice. So if you haven't yet taken Calculus e.g. if you are doing a B.A., then you should at least do Cal 1 before taking this course.
